    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{1} & A reference week in August. & Pressure variation in flow-control regime \\

    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{2} & Scenario \#1 with empirical noise added to demand curves, supplies unchanged. & Linepack and pressure drift when using flow-control with uncertain demand.\\ 
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{3} & Scenario \#2 with insult at node 1. & Introduce the notion of survival time, and set baseline without any controls.\\ 
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{4} & Scenario \#3 with insult time change to trough of linepack timeseries. & Illustrate that survival times change with timing of insult.\\ 
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{5} & Scenario \#4 with step-wise supply increase from node \# 8. & Survival times lengthen, but become less certain. \\
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{6} & Scenario \#5 with step-wise curtailing of demand. & No low pressure crossings are found. The high pressure at node \# 8 shows need for finer control.\\
