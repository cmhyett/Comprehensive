This is the first manuscript of the joint NOGA (Power System Operator of Israel) and UArizona team. We aim in this manuscript
\begin{itemize}
    \item To explain specifics of the Natural Gas system of Israel, describe its minimal model and formulate main operational challenges related to uncertainty in production and consumption, also amplified by limited availability of resources. [Section \ref{sec:motivation}] 
    \item To describe basic modeling tools which allow us to study the system, including description of equations and of the software utilized. [Section \ref{sec:model}]
    \item To formulate operational scenarios, reflecting the aforementioned uncertainty, and present analysis and control solutions. [Section \ref{sec:scenarios}]
    \item To sketch further plans to extend the demonstrated methodologies towards (a) joint, and thus more realistic, modeling and control of natural gas and power systems of Israel; but also (b) formulating further practical and academic challenges towards exporting the developed methodology to other energy systems of the size comparable to the one of Israel. [Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.]
