The dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor provide a privileged view into important characteristics of turbulence, some of which include: local fluid deformation, strain, energy cascade, and intermittency. Recent work using Tensor Basis Neural Network for the evolution of the velocity gradient tensor has performed very well. In this work we closely examine the individual contributions from the components of this physics-informed machine learning framework in search of interpretability. We find that not all components contribute to the prediction, and thus an even simpler description is possible. We conclude by postulating physical justification of this further-reduced description.
