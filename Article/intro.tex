This manuscript is an example-driven survey of broadly termed ``data-enhanced dynamical systems modeling'' (DataDyn). Underneath the umbrella of DataDyn, I allow any enriching of theoretical dynamical systems modeling with data. I will focus on the not exhaustive list of:
\begin{itemize}
\item parameterizing ODE/PDE/SDEs at a variety of levels
  \begin{itemize}
  \item single parameter searches 
  \item fitting neural networks to define dynamics
  \item parameterized boundary condition determination
  \end{itemize}
\item creating reduced-order models (ROM) via applying projection methods to data
  \begin{itemize}
  \item linear (PCA/POD) methods
  \item nonlinear autoencoder/decoder
  \end{itemize}
\item using differentiable programming (DP) and automatic differentiation to allow for automatic sensitivity calculation of DE solutions w.r.t. parameterizations
\item applying specifically structured neural networks to improve interpretability and generalizability
\item learning discretizations for PDEs
\end{itemize}
