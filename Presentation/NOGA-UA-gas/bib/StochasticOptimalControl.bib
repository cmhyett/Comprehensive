	abstract = {We reformulate a class of non-linear stochastic optimal control problems introduced by Todorov (in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 19, pp. 1369–1376, 2007) as a Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization problem. As a result, the optimal control computation reduces to an inference computation and approximate inference methods can be applied to efficiently compute approximate optimal controls. We show how this KL control theory contains the path integral control method as a special case. We provide an example of a block stacking task and a multi-agent cooperative game where we demonstrate how approximate inference can be successfully applied to instances that are too complex for exact computation. We discuss the relation of the KL control approach to other inference approaches to control.},

	abstract = {We present Path Integral Sampler{\textasciitilde}(PIS), a novel algorithm to draw samples from unnormalized probability density functions. The PIS is built on the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger bridge problem which aims to recover the most likely evolution of a diffusion process given its initial distribution and terminal distribution. The PIS draws samples from the initial distribution and then propagates the samples through the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger bridge to reach the terminal distribution. Applying the Girsanov theorem, with a simple prior diffusion, we formulate the PIS as a stochastic optimal control problem whose running cost is the control energy and terminal cost is chosen according to the target distribution. By modeling the control as a neural network, we establish a sampling algorithm that can be trained end-to-end. We provide theoretical justification of the sampling quality of PIS in terms of Wasserstein distance when sub-optimal control is used. Moreover, the path integrals theory is used to compute importance weights of the samples to compensate for the bias induced by the sub-optimality of the controller and time-discretization. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of PIS compared with other start-of-the-art sampling methods on a variety of tasks.},

	abstract = {A Markov decision process (MDP) framework is adopted to represent ensemble control of devices with cyclic energy consumption patterns, e.g., thermostatically controlled loads. Specifically we utilize and develop the class of MDP models previously coined linearly solvable MDPs, that describe optimal dynamics of the probability distribution of an ensemble of many cycling devices. Two principally different settings are discussed. First, we consider optimal strategy of the ensemble aggregator balancing between minimization of the cost of operations and minimization of the ensemble welfare penalty, where the latter is represented as a KL-divergence between actual and normal probability distributions of the ensemble. Then, second, we shift to the demand response setting modeling the aggregator's task to minimize the welfare penalty under the condition that the aggregated consumption matches the targeted time-varying consumption requested by the system operator. We discuss a modification of both settings aimed at encouraging or constraining the transitions between different states. The dynamic programming feature of the resulting modified MDPs is always preserved; however, `linear solvability' is lost fully or partially, depending on the type of modification. We also conducted some (limited in scope) numerical experimentation using the formulations of the first setting. We conclude by discussing future generalizations and applications.},

	abstract = {Pursuing a drifting target in a turbulent flow is an extremely difficult task whenever the searcher has limited propulsion and maneuvering capabilities. Even in the case when the relative distance between pursuer and target stays below the turbulent dissipative scale, the chaotic nature of the trajectory of the target represents a formidable challenge. Here, we show how to successfully apply optimal control theory to find navigation strategies that overcome chaotic dispersion and allow the searcher to reach the target in a minimal time. We contrast the results of optimal control -- which requires perfect observability and full knowledge of the dynamics of the environment -- with heuristic algorithms that are reactive -- relying on local, instantaneous information about the flow. While the latter display significantly worse performances, optimally controlled pursuers can track the target for times much longer than the typical inverse Lyapunov exponent and are considerably more robust.},

Path integral methods find the control that minimizes the expected cost-to-go. In this paper we show that under the same assumptions, path integral methods generalize directly to risk sensitive stochastic optimal control. Here the method minimizes in expectation an exponentially weighted cost-to-go. Depending on the exponential weight, risk seeking or risk averse behaviour is obtained. We demonstrate the approach on risk sensitive stochastic optimal control problems beyond the linear-quadratic case, showing the intricate interaction of multi-modal control with risk sensitivity.},
