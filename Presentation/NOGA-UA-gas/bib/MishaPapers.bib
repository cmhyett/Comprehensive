To allow for a less centralized operating paradigm, consumer-end perspective and abilities should be integrated in current dispatch practices and accounted for in switching between different energy sources not only at the system but also at the individual consumer level. Since consumers are confined within different built environments, this paper looks into an opportunity to control energy consumption of an aggregation of many residential, commercial and industrial consumers, into an ensemble.

              We study an ensemble of diverse (inhomogeneous) thermostatically controlled loads aggregated to provide the demand response (DR) services in a district-level energy system. Each load in the ensemble is assumed to be equipped with a random number generator switching heating/cooling on or off with a Poisson rate,
              r
              , when the load leaves the comfort zone. Ensemble diversity is modeled through inhomogeneity/disorder in the deterministic dynamics of loads. Approached from the standpoint of statistical physics, the ensemble represents a non-equilibrium system driven away from its natural steady state by the DR. The ability of the ensemble to recover by mixing faster to the steady state after its DR’s use is advantageous. The trade-off between the level of the aggregator’s control, commanding the devices to lower the rate
              r
              , and the phase-space-oscillatory deterministic dynamics is analyzed. Then, we study the effect of the load diversity, investigating four different disorder probability distributions (DPDs) ranging from the case of the Gaussian DPD to the case of the uniform with finite support DPD. We show that stronger regularity of the DPD results in faster mixing, which is similar to the Landau damping in plasma physics. Our theoretical analysis is supported by extensive numerical validation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Thermostatically controlled loads, e.g., air conditioners and heaters, are by far the most widespread consumers of electricity. Normally the devices are calibrated to provide the so-called bang-bang control – changing from on to off, and vice versa, depending on temperature. We considered aggregation of a large group of similar devices into a statistical ensemble, where the devices operate following the same dynamics, subject to stochastic perturbations and randomized, Poisson on/off switching policy. Using theoretical and computational tools of statistical physics, we analyzed how the ensemble relaxes to a stationary distribution and established a relationship between the relaxation and the statistics of the probability flux associated with devices’ cycling in the mixed (discrete, switch on/off, and continuous temperature) phase space. This allowed us to derive the spectrum of the non-equilibrium (detailed balance broken) statistical system and uncover how switching policy affects oscillatory trends and the speed of the relaxation. Relaxation of the ensemble is of practical interest because it describes how the ensemble recovers from significant perturbations, e.g., forced temporary switching off aimed at utilizing the flexibility of the ensemble to provide “demand response” services to change consumption temporarily to balance a larger power grid. We discuss how the statistical analysis can guide further development of the emerging demand response technology.},

	abstract = {A Markov decision process (MDP) framework is adopted to represent ensemble control of devices with cyclic energy consumption patterns, e.g., thermostatically controlled loads. Specifically we utilize and develop the class of MDP models previously coined linearly solvable MDPs, that describe optimal dynamics of the probability distribution of an ensemble of many cycling devices. Two principally different settings are discussed. First, we consider optimal strategy of the ensemble aggregator balancing between minimization of the cost of operations and minimization of the ensemble welfare penalty, where the latter is represented as a KL-divergence between actual and normal probability distributions of the ensemble. Then, second, we shift to the demand response setting modeling the aggregator's task to minimize the welfare penalty under the condition that the aggregated consumption matches the targeted time-varying consumption requested by the system operator. We discuss a modification of both settings aimed at encouraging or constraining the transitions between different states. The dynamic programming feature of the resulting modified MDPs is always preserved; however, `linear solvability' is lost fully or partially, depending on the type of modification. We also conducted some (limited in scope) numerical experimentation using the formulations of the first setting. We conclude by discussing future generalizations and applications.},
