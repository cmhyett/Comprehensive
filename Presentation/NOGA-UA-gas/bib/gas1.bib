	abstract = {The revolution of hydraulic fracturing has dramatically increased the supply and lowered the cost of natural gas in the United States driving an expansion of natural gas-fired generation capacity in many electrical grids. Unrelated to the natural gas expansion, lower capital costs and renewable portfolio standards are driving an expansion of intermittent renewable generation capacity such as wind and photovoltaic generation. These two changes may potentially combine to create new threats to the reliability of these interdependent energy infrastructures. Natural gas-fired generators are often used to balance the fluctuating output of wind generation. However, the time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying natural gas burn rates that impact the pressure in interstate transmission pipelines. Fluctuating pressure impacts the reliability of natural gas deliveries to those same generators and the safety of pipeline operations. We adopt a partial differential equation model of natural gas pipelines and use this model to explore the effect of intermittent wind generation on the fluctuations of pressure in natural gas pipelines. The mean square pressure fluctuations are found to grow linearly in time with points of maximum deviation occurring at the locations of flow reversals.},

    abstract = "{Economic, technological, and political factors have encouraged the extensive installation of gas-fired power plants in the United States, which has caused electric systems to depend heavily on reliable gas supplies. This has greatly strengthened the interdependence between the electric power and natural gas industries. Recently, the intra-day fluctuations in pipeline loads that arise from changes in gas-fired electric power plant operation have become particularly problematic. In order to provide pipeline operators better insight into these loads, this paper describes the procedures used by power system operators to decide when and where electric generators are committed to operate, and at what level. We place particular emphasis on the evolving role played by gas-fired generators. In addition, we discuss recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) policy changes that aim to improve operational coordination between the two industry sectors.New extraction technologies, cheaper gas, and other factors have led to widespread installation of gas-fired electric power plants and caused the electric power grid to depend on reliable gas supplies. Recently, natural gas has eclipsed coal as the largest fuel source for electric power production in the US. Gas-fired generators are advantageous for meeting peak electric loads and providing rapid-response contingency power. However, these attributes can cause high and unpredictable intra-day variability in takes from gas transmission pipelines. These new conditions create challenges for current methods for flow scheduling and real-time physical control. The resulting impacts on pipeline efficiency, capacity, and security often translate to gas price fluctuations, supply disruptions, and increased operating expenses. Better coordination between the electric power generation and natural gas transmission industries would mitigate some of these problems. However, coordination between power and gas industry markets and intra-day planning of physical operations is nontrivial.In the gas marketplace, day-ahead and intra-day bilateral gas contracts are purchased, sold, and cleared. These agreements are based on steady rated gas takes, and gas transmission companies then use this information to create operational plans. The resulting flow schedules are based on capacities rated by FERC regulations, which are estimated using steady-state flow models. Real-time pipeline control is then performed in reaction to customer behaviors that may not be communicated in advance. This approach to pipeline scheduling and control is satisfactory when nearly all customers were local distribution companies (LDCs), which are firm contract holders whose takes were more predictable and far less variable. In current markets where over half the gas customers are electric power plants who purchase non-firm contracts, this approach may not be sufficient to guarantee supplies to non-firm contract buyers with highly variable demand. Today, operators need to make decisions in a limited time-frame based on only a handful of scenarios that were evaluated using transient simulations.}",

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive solution to the long-standing transient gas pipeline optimization problem. Consider a pipeline with time dependent delivery volumes at various load points. Such a system can be controlled by changing with time the pressure setpoints at stations to manipulate flow and linepack. We present an algorithm that computes an optimum set of time-varying setpoint values (out to a user-specified simulation horizon) simultaneously for all stations. These setpoint values are computed so that 1. From a current state of a pipeline, we achieve a desired (generally different) target state 2. We achieve this target state in a predetermined time interval, T, from the current state when time t= 0 3. Only controls that are available to the pipeline operator are exercised 4. We observe all pressure constraints and horsepower limitations 5. Pack is managed to meet all required time-varying deliveries within the interval T 6. Total compression power or fuel expended during interval T is minimized This algorithm can therefore be used both on pipelines that supply time-varying loads and seldom operate near steady state, and pipelines that need to transit periodically between differing steady states as load patterns change. It has been tested on gunbarrel and branched systems. The paper presents results from a 311-mile 7-station gunbarrel pipeline system patterned after an actual field system. The sample scenarios are not based on field data but are designed to illustrate functionality.The purpose of this paper is to present a new algorithm to assist pipeline operators in controlling linepack and fuel consumption so as to enable projected deliveries in a transient environment. The intent is to address the types of operating questions presented by contemporary pipeline operations during a required transition to meet new forecasted loads:How most efficiently to achieve in a specified time, T, a prescribed state designed to handle forecast loadsHow to deal with changing or unexpected loads during the transition to time THow to recognize unused capacity and quantitatively assess spot load capability during THow to minimize the total compression fuel (or power) expended to time T, observing all constraints.The principal successes in optimal control of gas pipelines have historically resulted from establishing operating conditions to optimize the cost of transporting gas under steady state conditions. Given a forecast of loads and a detailed nonlinear model of the pipeline hydraulics and compressor characteristics, a steady state optimum provides the operator with a valuable set of controls that would meet the projected loads in an optimal and sustainable way, while observing all system limitations such as MAOP. Steady state optimization is also an invaluable tool for planning and design, in that it can quickly determine maximum sustainable throughput as well as most efficient operation for any proposed design and/or potential loading condition. However, steady state optimization is clearly not the complete solution to the problem of efficient pipeline operations.},

	title = {Using {Optimization} {In} {Transient} {Gas} {Transmission}},
	abstract = {This paper reviews a decade of progress and presents new results. Short-term transient loads significantly degrade average (steady) pipeline capacity. Several papers show that transient optimization (T.O.) can recover much of this lost potential. The goal of T.O. technology is to support gas pipeline operators in optimally managing line-pack under time-varying loads, even when the location and timing of large peaking loads is uncertain. While in a transient environment the approach can minimize fuel and operational cost, its greatest potential lies in maximizing average attainable pipeline capacity in pipelines forced by users into transient operation. We review prior work showing a broad variety of circumstances in gun-barrel, Y-structures and simple loops where T.O. can be useful for both analysis and real time support. We then summarize progress of current work to turn "back room experimentation" into technology useable by operators on arbitrary pipelines. Finally, this paper presents new work using optimization to determine an accurate pipeline state quickly from only the most recent ½-hour SCADA history. Examples show this functionality can be effective even if some data are bad or missing. Robust state-finding is essential for initializing transient optimization in real-time support. The paper concludes by showing how new technology works in general, complex, previously T.O.-untreatable pipeline structures.1.Steady state optimization (SSO) of gas pipelines is now a mature technology. This approach can determine the optimum pressure set-points and station bypass configurations of a general pipeline system to deliver the most gas possible using the least fuel, given supply and delivery pressures and a model of the system (including constraints). The resulting steady state of the pipeline (the flow and pressure by milepost) is useful as an ideal target. But SSO cannot address the issue of how to control the pipeline to maximize profit while delivering transient loads and achieving an optimal state for making tomorrow's deliveries. A decade ago a client asked how to control a pipeline to transit from a current to an optimum SSO-defined target state at day's end while maintaining all safety margins and successfully meeting rapidly changing client deliveries. Dialing in tomorrow's optimum target set-points and waiting does not guarantee attaining the desired state. It can also lead to pressure violations or delivery failure during the transition period. Moreover, the wait may be unacceptably long. We first addressed operational optimization in work reported at PSIG in 2000 using a hypothetical 25-station 1000-mile transmission gun-barrel pipeline as an example. To make deliveries and achieve the target goal efficiently and safely, we learned that the linepack must be managed in a coordinated way to move it continuously to the time-dependent optimum locations and release it in the right way. This pack management was achieved by manipulating station setpoints over time to move pack to the desired flowing state. Indeed we further learned how to manage linepack to deliver any number of transient loads in the meantime, all the while satisfying constraints1. This new technology was termed Transient Optimization (T.O.), and appeared to be a useful innovation. In the past there were no tools to aid operators in the sometimes difficult job of dynamically manipulating line-pack, or in rigorously determining the feasibility of time-dependent load patterns imposed by shippers.},

	title = {Optimizing {Line}-{Pack} {Management} to {Hedge} {Against} {Future} {Load} {Uncertainty}},
	abstract = {Optimization techniques can be used to generate, in advance, control strategies for efficiently operating pipelines through periods of fluctuating loads. A control strategy is simply a specific schedule for changing compressor station set point values during a particular scenario period. The methods are particularly valuable when used to determine how to position line-pack resources to meet upcoming stressful conditions, such as the onset of electric power plant loads, or even loads temporarily in excess of sustained pipeline capacity.[1][2] We present extensions to these methods that address the question of future uncertainty in load patterns. Rather than consider a single possible future load scenario, the methods allow inclusion of several scenarios simultaneously. For instance, one scenario might consider the case where no power plants come online, a second might consider plants coming online for 6 hours on one part of the system, and a third might consider a different power plant coming on in a remote part of the system but with an uncertain onset time. Optimal pack management strategies for each particular expected load considered individually may differ widely from the optimal strategy needed to prepare for meeting any one of several possible loads. Therefore, in our new approach, rather than committing at the outset to one possible future in generating a control plan, we generate one that positions line-pack defensively before the possible loads so as to be able to meet any of the included future load pattern scenarios efficiently. The concept is analogous to "hedging" in the financial world. The computed set point schedule will, at each point in time, position line-pack in the proper strategic distribution to allow operators to dependably and efficiently meet whichever load pattern actually occurs. We present examples of this hedging with several scenarios.The goal of a transmission pipeline is to move gas from suppliers to end customers in contracted amounts, dependably and with minimum complications. Two of the major complications in operations and planning are fluctuating pipeline conditions, and uncertainty about the future. Fluctuating pipeline conditions are easy to conceptualize, although sometimes difficult to manage. Tomorrow's customer loads may be distributed differently from today's loads due to changing weather and market conditions. Equipment availability may be different tomorrow due to maintenance or outages. Ambient temperature (and hence compression capacity) may be different tomorrow. All of these examples imply that one may need a different operational plan for tomorrow than was used today in order to operate efficiently, profitably, and safely. Tomorrow's operational plan is thus often generated using steady state optimization tools loaded with tomorrow's expected (average) conditions. Having a different plan for tomorrow also implies that you need to be able to transition the system from today's conditions to tomorrow's conditions, dependably and with minimum complications. This is complicated by the fact that some customer loads do not typically ramp smoothly from "today's" state to "tomorrow's" state but may fluctuate widely from hour to hour.},

	title = {Using {Power} {Grid} {Schedules} in {Dynamic} {Optimization} of {Gas} {Pipelines}},
	abstract = {The recent increase in the use of natural gas as a fuel for electricity production has greatly strengthened the interdependence between the electric power and natural gas industries. The resulting intra-day fluctuations in pipeline loads caused by intermittent or unexpected gas-fired electric power plant operations have become particularly problematic. To mitigate this issue, regulatory changes have been initiated to lower the barriers on communication between operators of power grids and gas pipelines. In this paper, we examine some types of intra-day operational information that pipeline managers can obtain from power grid operators in order to forecast time-varying pipeline loads and characterize uncertainty of these loads in space and time. We also present methods that could be developed by the pipeline simulation industry to more effectively use such information to mitigate intra-day gas-electricity interdependence issues. Specifically, we describe new techniques for using transient optimization to find feasible compressor operation schedules, which are resilient under uncertainty, given such power system data. Bringing these methods into practice can enable gas pipelines to reduce the risk of service interruptions caused by intermittent power plant activity. Additionally, pipelines will be able to more reliably service power plants that use their gas nominations during only part of the day, or that may start up or shut down with little warning.Extensive gas-fired power plant construction, as well as subsequent utilization of these plants to serve peak electric loads and provide generating reserves, has caused electric power grids to increasingly depend on greater and more reliable gas supplies. Such gas-fired generation can be intermittent, which causes large and sudden variations in takes from high pressure gas pipelines. These conditions lead to gas price fluctuations, line pressure drops, operational flow orders, and increased operating expenses for both industry sectors. Because natural gas is now the largest fuel source used for electric power production in many regions of North America, interest in coordinating the operations of these systems has grown. However, natural gas pipelines and power grids operate on very different spatial and temporal scales, and this makes the coordination of market clearing procedures and physical infrastructure operations difficult.While gas is purchased using nominations for steady takes over 12 to 24 hour intervals, power system operators often require gas-fired generators to commit to production schedules in which their nomination is burned over only part of the contract period. Furthermore, this schedule may change unexpectedly because of real-time re-dispatch and reserve generator activation. Thus, pipelines must use line pack and storage to balance supply rates with variable and uncertain delivery volumes. In light of this, pipeline system managers would benefit greatly from information about upcoming or possible changes in gas takes. Adapting pipeline operations to maximize efficiency and security under these new conditions requires simulation and optimization methods that accurately account for transient flows. It is well-understood that transient optimization methods for managing time-varying flows throughout intercontinental pipeline systems require a predictive element to be effective, because changes in one pipeline zone may take many hours to be felt in a different, distant zone. Specifically, information about the volume, timing, and uncertainty of variable and intermittent gas takes is necessary. These variations are currently caused primarily by the commitment and re-dispatch of gas-fired generators.},
